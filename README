Install
=======

*Yaafe* source code should compile on *linux* and *MacOsX* platform, and uses CMake as compilation tool.
Yaafe requires thirdparty libraries to enable specific features. Some of these library may already be available on your system.

The `argtable <http://argtable.sourceforge.net/>`_ library is required.

Depending on optional features you want to use, other librairies may be used:

* `libsndfile <http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/>`_: enable reading WAV files format (highly recommanded)
* `libmpg123 <http://http://www.mpg123.de/api/>`_: enable reading MP3 audio files
* `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_ >= 1.8: enable H5 output format
* `liblapack <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/>`_: enable some audio features (LSF)
* `FFTW3 <http://www.fftw.org/>`_: use FFTW instead of Eigen for FFT computations (pay attention to licensing issues when linking with the GPL FFTW3 library).

To use the *yaafe.py* script you need Python >= 2.5, and the numpy package.

Once previous libraries are installed (some may have been locally installed in <lib-path>),
you can compile with the following steps:

 1. mkdir build
 2. cd build
 3. ccmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<lib-path> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-path> ..
 4. make
 5. make install

Several options can control Yaafe compilation. More details can be found at:
   https://yaafe.sourceforge.net/manual/install.html


Environment
===========

You *must* set your YAAFE_PATH environment var to the "yaafe_extensions" dir so that yaafe can find available features.
export YAAFE_PATH=$DEST_DIR/yaafe_extensions

To easily use Yaafe, you should set the following environment vars:
export PATH=$PATH:$DEST_DIR/bin
# on MacOsX replace LD_LIBRARY_PATH => DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$DEST_DIR/lib
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$DEST_DIR/python_packages

if you use Matlab, you can set your MATLABPATH var:
export MATLABPATH=$MATLABPATH:$DEST_DIR/matlab


Documentation
=============

Documentation is also available online: http://yaafe.sourceforge.net/

To build documentation, you need Sphinx.
Before building documentation, you should set your environment correctly so that sphinx builds documentation
with automatic features documentation.

To build documentation, just run ``make doc`` in the ``build` directory. Documentation is built in doc/html directory.
